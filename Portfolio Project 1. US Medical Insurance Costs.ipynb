The reason for this is not obvious yet, therefore this could be further explored by comparing the average age and bmi of males to females, checking to see if there is also a link between sex and smoking or sex and number of children in this dataset. This will be explored below."

    "In this project, data on U.S. medical insurance costs were analysed. The data was able to prove the assumption that patients who smoke have higher insurance costs compared to non-smokers given the health risks of smoking. The average age of the patients was 40 years old whereby males were slightly younger than the females. Despite this, it was found that men had a higher average insurance cost compared to females. Investigating this lead to a discovery that more of the males in the dataset were smokers which is likely to have had an impact on their higher insurance costs."
